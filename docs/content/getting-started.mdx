# Getting Started

Get up and running with Auth HI! in minutes.

## Installation

### From Chrome Web Store

> 🚀 **Coming Soon** - Extension is currently in review

Once published, click "Add to Chrome" from the Chrome Web Store listing.

### From Source

If you want to build from source or contribute:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/prosdevlab/auth-header-injector.git
cd auth-header-injector

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build the extension
pnpm build

# Load in Chrome
# 1. Open chrome://extensions/
# 2. Enable "Developer mode"
# 3. Click "Load unpacked"
# 4. Select the `dist` folder
```

## First Steps

### 1. Open the Side Panel

Click the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar. The side panel will open on the right side of your browser.

### 2. Enable the Extension

Toggle the "Enable extension" switch at the top of the panel.

### 3. Add Your First Rule

Click "Add Rule" and fill in:

- **Pattern**: URL pattern to match (e.g., `*.api.example.com`)
- **Token**: Your authentication token
- **Scheme**: Choose Bearer (default), Raw, or Basic
- **Label**: Optional friendly name (e.g., "Staging API")

Click "Save" and you're done!

**Auth Schemes:**
- **Bearer**: Adds `Authorization: Bearer {token}` header (most common)
- **Raw**: Adds `Authorization: {token}` header (for APIs expecting raw tokens)
- **Basic**: Adds `Authorization: Basic {token}` header (token should be base64-encoded)

### 4. Verify It's Working

1. Navigate to a page that makes API calls matching your pattern
2. Check the "Context Bar" at the top - it shows matched rules and request counts
3. See request counts increase as API calls are intercepted
4. Click the request count to expand and see domain-level breakdown
5. Open DevTools → Network tab → Check request headers

## Example: GitHub API

Let's set up auth for GitHub's API:

**Pattern**: `*github.com`  
**Token**: `ghp_yourPersonalAccessToken`  
**Label**: `GitHub API`

Now any requests to `github.com` or `api.github.com` will include your auth token automatically!
