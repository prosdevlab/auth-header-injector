# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** December 23, 2025

## Data Collection

Auth HI! does **NOT** collect, transmit, or share any user data.

## Data Storage

All data (authentication rules and tokens) is stored locally on your device using Chrome's sync storage.

This data:
- **Never leaves your device** except through Chrome's built-in sync (if you enable Chrome sync)
- **Is NOT transmitted** to any external servers
- **Is NOT accessible** to the extension developers
- **Syncs only through Chrome's native sync** (if enabled in your Chrome settings)

## What We Store

### Locally on Your Device

- **Authentication rules**: URL patterns, tokens, labels, and enabled/disabled state
- **Request statistics**: Domain-level request counts and timestamps (no request content)

### What We DON'T Store

- Request URLs
- Request/response bodies
- Request headers (except what you configure)
- Response data
- User analytics or telemetry
- Any personally identifiable information

## Permissions Usage

We request these Chrome permissions for core functionality:

### `declarativeNetRequest`
**Purpose:** Inject authentication headers into matching HTTP requests  
**Data access:** None - only modifies outgoing request headers based on your rules

### `storage`
**Purpose:** Store your authentication rules locally  
**Data access:** Only your configured rules, stored encrypted by Chrome

### `tabs`
**Purpose:** Detect current page URL for context-aware UI  
**Data access:** Only current tab URL to show relevant rules

### `sidePanel`
**Purpose:** Display the extension UI  
**Data access:** None - just displays the interface

### `webRequest`
**Purpose:** Track request statistics (counts only)  
**Data access:** Only request URLs for counting, no content

### `host_permissions (<all_urls>)`
**Purpose:** Allow header injection on domains you configure  
**Data access:** Only requests matching your patterns
